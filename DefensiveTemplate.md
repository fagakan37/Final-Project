Network Topology

The following machines were identified on the network:
Hypervisor / Host Machine (Not a VM)
Operating System: Microsoft Windows
Purpose: Hypervisor / Gateway
IP Address: 192.168.1.1
ELK
Operating System: Linux
Purpose: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana Server
IP Address: 192.168.1.100
Capstone
Operating System: Linux
Purpose: Basic HTTP Server (this is a red herring)
IP Address: 192.168.1.105
Target 1
Operating System: Linux
Purpose: HTTP Server (also wordpress site)
IP Address: 192.168.1.110
Target 2
Operating System: Linux
Purpose: HTTP Server
IP Address: 192.168.1.115

Description of Targets

The target of this attack was: Target 1 (192.168.1.110).

Target 1 is an Apache web server and has SSH enabled, so ports 80 and 22 are possible ports of entry for attackers. As such, the following alerts have been implemented:

Monitoring the Targets
-Excessive HTTP Errors
-HTTP Request Size Monitor
-CPU Usage Monitor

Traffic to these services should be carefully monitored. To this end, we have implemented the alerts below:

Name of Alert 1
-Excessive HTTP Errors
Alert 1 is implemented as follows:
  - Metric: http.response.status_code > 400
  - Threshold:  5 in last 5 minutes
  - Vulnerability Mitigated: Alert notify the security team help identify attacks & block the ip, change the password, & close or filter the port 22
  - Reliability: This alert is highly reliable in identifying brute force attacks. It does not generate false positives 

Name of Alert 2
-HTTP Request Size Monitor
Alert 2 is implemented as follows:
  -Metric: http.request.bytes
  -Threshold: 0.5 in last 5 minutes
  -Vulnerability Mitigated: By controlling the number of http request size through a filter it protects against DDOS attacks 
  -Reliability: No, this alert doesn't generate a lot of false positives bc it is reliable

Name of Alert 3
CPU Usage Monitor
Alert 3 is implemented as follows:
  -Metric: system.process.cpu.total.pct
  -Threshold:
  -Vulnerability Mitigated: If there is any memory dump as a result of any stored information generated, CPU percentage at 50% will trigger
  - Reliability: It is reliable eventhough the CUP can spike not neccessarily because of attacks

_TODO Note: Explain at least 3 alerts. Add more if time allows._

Suggestions for Going Further (Optional)
 
- Each alert above pertains to a specific vulnerability/exploit. Recall that alerts only detect malicious behavior, but do not stop it. For each vulnerability/exploit identified by the alerts above, suggest a patch. E.g., implementing a blocklist is an effective tactic against brute-force attacks. It is not necessary to explain _how_ to implement each patch.

The logs and alerts generated during the assessment suggest that this network is susceptible to several active threats, identified by the alerts above. In addition to watching for occurrences of such threats, the network should be hardened against them. The Blue Team suggests that IT implement the fixes below to protect the network:

Vulnerability 1- Excessive HTTP Errors

Patch: Needs a stronger password policy in the user account settings. Update the account password policy in Windows group policy through /etc/security/pwquality.conf & through /etc/security/pwquality.conf in Linux
Why It Works: Strong and complexed passwords are almost impossible to guess or brute force

Vulnerability 2 - HTTP Request Size Monitor

Patch: Use advanced intrusion prevention and threat management systems, which combine firewalls, VPN, anti-spam, content filtering, load balancing, and other layers of DDoS defense techniques. Together they enable constant and consistent network protection to prevent a DDoS attack from happening. This includes everything from identifying possible traffic inconsistencies with the highest level of precision in blocking the attack
Why It Works: Given the complexity of DDoS attacks, thereâ€™s hardly a way to defend against them without appropriate systems to identify anomalies in traffic and provide instant response. Backed by secure infrastructure and a battle-plan, such systems can minimize the threat.

Vulnerability 3 - CPU Usage Monitor

Patch: Use Host Instrusion Prevention System to identify DOS attack
Why It Works: Monitoring the code behavior will stop the malware
